<p style=""text-align: left;"">NIBC, originally called the &lsquo;Maatschappij tot Financiering van Nationaal Herstel&#39;, was founded in 1945 by the Dutch government along with a number of commercial banks and institutional investors. It was set up to provide financing for the post-World War II economic recovery of the Netherlands. Renamed De Nationale Investeringsbank (DNIB) in 1971, it was listed on the Dutch stock exchange from 1986 to 1999. In 1999, two of Europe&#39;s largest pension funds, ABP and PGGM, made a public offer for the shares of DNIB through a new joint venture, named NIB Capital N.V. They acquired a 85 percent stake, leaving the Dutch government with a minority interest of 15 percent. NIB Capital acquired these remaining shares from the Dutch State in May 2004.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">NIBC offers services regarding debt and equity mezzanine, mergers &amp; acquisitions, capitalisation advisory, leveraged finance, structured finance, research and brokerage services and capital markets solutions.</p>
